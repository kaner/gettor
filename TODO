These are planned changes to the gettor system.

- Split (at least) tiger bundle into several smaller archives to avoid ~20MB
- React in some way if the user requested a split download but no split 
  downloads are available for that specific package (maybe send out the non-
  split version of the package?)
- Update https://www.torproject.org/gettor/ 
- Write instructions on the website on how to use GetTor. Put that site into
  pootle for translation so for example chinese and iranian users have a
  reference for help
- Package names that are sent out to the user are currently hard-coded. Return
  to a more dynamic approach, also: Add a nice little note about the size of 
  the files users may request
- Remove 'localhost:25' to send mail and use '/usr/bin/sendmail' instead
  (suggested by weasel)
- Implement test (-t switch) functionality
- Add torbutton (Mike, please sign torbutton and populate a proper .asc)
- Add GetTor to GetTor and it will be able to distribute itself
- Merge checkInternalEarlyBlacklist() in requests.py with the real blacklist
  mechanism of GetTor
  Related:
  - Make blacklists learn wildcards: Something like "*@torproject.org" as a 
    reply-to address should really be blacklisted, for instance.
- Come up with something more elegant than torSpecialPackageExpansion() in
  requests.py. Hardcoding package names in other places than packages.py is
  inviting bugs.
